            <h3>Keeping them going</h3>
            <p>
            This is very simple for domestic use. I'm assuming you arent about to start a bakery.
            </p>
            <p>
                Put your starter in the fridge in an airtight container. I keep my wheat starter in a plastic takeaway container. I keep my rye starter in a small glass mason jar - about 200ml or 6fl oz. They are just what i had to hand, and i'm sure i could swap them over without issues<br/>
                    </p>
            <p>

            when you replenish what you've taken out (aka feeding), don't fill the container more that 2/3 full, as it will expand.
            </p>
            <p>
            There is no <i>fancy</i> feeding scheme needed, just replace what you have taken out with a mix of flour and water. I try to keep the ratios in the starter the same as the ratio of flour to water in the 'standard' bread loaf that I tend to make - that's usually about two scoops of flour to one of water, or if you weighing, then the weight of water is about 65% of the weight of the flour.  but only because it then removes this as a factor when I'm figuring out the right quantities to scale up or down a recipe. it's not because this is only thing that works, and it's not disastrous if you don't do this, you'll just need to adjust the water in the final loaf you make from it. I used to used 100% hydration (same weight of flour and water) and that works fine too. There's also no magic about timing either. Feed it, put it in the fridge, wait a couple of days before using it again, or if you want to use it again sooner, just leave it on the counter for a few hours before before  returning to the fridge           
            </p>
            <p>            
            I use organic white or wholemeal for my wheat starter- it seems to make no difference
            <p>
           
            You can leave (ignore) it in the fridge for 2-3 weeks without any noticeable change in it's behaviour - certainly when I go away on holiday it's around 3 weeks between uses - it just seems to go dormant once it uses the available flour and then waits for new flour, or use it every 2-3 days. If you are using it more frequently - say daily or every other day - just leave it out on the counter at room temperature (18-20 deg centigrade) for a couple of hours or longer if you have used a lot of it. You can use almost all of it - no need to keep back 50%, you can use 90-95% of what you have in the container if needed, but make sure you give it a good mix when you replenish the flour and water, and if you are using this much regularly, then you may need a bigger container.<br/>

            You don't need to throw any away and feed just to keep it going unless perhaps you really aren't using it regularly - say a month or more between uses. if you plan to not use it for a while, you can just put some in the freezer just in case. <br/>
            </p>
            <p>

            I've used this scheme over the last 10-12 years, through 2 house moves, and have regularly ignored it for weeks at a time. it always just seems fine. Your mileage may vary, I'm neither a lawyer or a professional baker... <br/>

            <h3>Starting them off </h3>
            <p>
                I've only done this for rye - i've never needed to for wheat, so can't really comment, but i suspect it's pretty much the same, except possibly you need to be a little more patient            </p>
            <p>
                Put one scoop of rye flour , plus one scoop water in a container and mix them, then leave with the lid off, at room temperature. leave it overnight. Repeat each day for a week. You are looking for signs of bubbles in the mix.
                if you have too much for the jar (don't fill more that 2/3 full), then remove some of it, and continue as before. 
                 within a few days, you'll start to see bubbles, give it another day until there are bubbles throughout and at that point you can treat it as detailed above.
